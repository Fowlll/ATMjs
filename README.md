# ATMjs
A simulation of ATM software written in javascript.

This little software has no real goal but to spend my time coding it.

I used NodeJS for the web server. I didn't implements a real backend system yet.

If you wanna try it, just clone the repo and launch the app.js file with the following command:
node ./app.js
